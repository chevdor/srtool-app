= srtool app

== todo and plans, wishes and idea:

- some users may have all the tools such as git & co. Those need to be able to pick the folder of their choice and we need to work there.
- other users may not have git nor the will to install it. In this case, we can download the zip of a given tagged version
- we need to be able to fetch the list of available tags for the user to pick
- advanced users will simply checkout whatever commit ref
- when picking a tag, the user should see the DATE of it
- docker is mandatory so we need to check
- copy / export report
- check with release notes and show a big green box
- show progress during compile
- works on MacOS, Windows, Linux (check on Arm...)
- link to tweet result
- check for available update
- run checks at start
- allow background mode (slower but less taxing)
- show historical runs, recall them
- archive/export produced runtimes somewhere
- companion bin wrapper in Rust ?
- record of previous runs duration
- dark/light mode
- load show runtime version release notes

== Start checks

- git installed
- docker installed
- disk available
- number of OS CPUs (eventually warning)
- number of docker CPUs (eventually warning)

== local storage

- app settings
- cache/store results for each recall with previous run duration and result

== app settings:

- folder to use (when using a repo)
- temp folder
- wipe all data after process complete (only if NOT using a repo)
- allow skipping the checks
- delete image after use
- wipe target before build (cargo clean)
- wipe srtool target after build
- let user pick a `--cpus` value for docker (=> bakcground mode )
- support `--cpu-shares 1024` to play on the prio with other docker

== Usage

- select tag / version
- select chain
- Run and wait...
