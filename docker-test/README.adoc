= Docker test

This folder contains a Dockerfile that **looks** like srtool but only replays runs without compiling anything.
It makes it much lighter on CPU when you are testing but also much faster.

It can be called exactly like the real `srtool` image except that the name is `srtool-dev`. Special options are managed using `ENV`.

WARNING: This image does not provide a full mockup and most options/flags will be ignored. For instance the build will behave like calling srtool with `build --app` whatever options you pass.
