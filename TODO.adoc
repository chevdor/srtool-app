= todo and plans, wishes and idea:

Here is simply a bucket of ideas and no commitment regarding what and how features will be implemented.

== Basic

- [x] other users may not have git nor the will to install it. In this case, we can download the zip of a given tagged version
- [x] we need to be able to fetch the list of available tags for the user to pick
- [x] docker is mandatory so we need to check
- [ ] copy / export report
- [ ] check with release notes and show a big green box
- [x] show progress during compile
- [x] works on MacOS, Windows, Linux (check on Arm...)
- [ ] link to tweet result
- [x] check for available update
- [x] run checks at start

== Nice to have

- [ ] show historical runs, recall them
- [ ] record of previous runs duration
- [ ] archive/export produced runtimes somewhere
- [ ] load show runtime version release notes
- [ ] dark/light mode

== Advanced

- [ ] allow background mode (slower but less taxing)
- [ ] when picking a tag, the user should see the DATE of it
- [ ] advanced users will simply checkout whatever commit ref
- [ ] some users may have all the tools such as git & co. Those need to be able to pick the folder of their choice and we need to work there.
- [ ] companion bin wrapper in Rust ?
