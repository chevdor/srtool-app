= Usage

Using {prj} is rather straight forward. When you start {prj}, it will perform a few checks and initialize your system. 

Once {prj} is ready, you will be able to select:

- a version
- a runtime

Pressing the button will then start building your runtime. 

WARNING: Building a runtime from scratch does take a long time. While some machines will manage under 10 minutes, some older computers may need up to 2 hours. {prj} constantly shows the status so make sure you don't interrupt the process once it runs.
