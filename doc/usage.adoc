= Usage

Using {prj} is rather straight forward. When you start {prj}, it will perform a few checks and initialize your system. 

IMPORTANT: {prj} requires Docker to be installed and running. You do need to do anything with Docker yourself though, it only needs to be available on your computer.

Once {prj} is ready, you will be able to select:

- a version: This is the usually the version of the client, it comes with a runtime
- a runtime: This is where you select the chain such as Kusama, Polkadot, etc...

Pressing the button will then start building your runtime. 

WARNING: Building a runtime from scratch does take a long time. While some machines will manage under 10 minutes, most computers may need up to 1 to 2 hours. {prj} constantly shows the status so make sure you don't interrupt the process once it runs.

== Windows users

Windows users will need to enable option in their Docker settings:

== Troubleshooting

If you run into some issues, there are a few steps you can take to try fixing them. If those don't help, please report the issue and provide as much details as you can, including the logs.

=== Config reset

In some cases, it may help resetting the configuration. You can simply delete the following file `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/srtool-app/config.json` and restart {prj}.

=== Docker reset

You may open Docker Desktop and click on the bug icon. You will find a few options that will restore docker to a clean state.
